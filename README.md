# ReactPack

This is a straight-ahead boilerplate (I know, I know ... another one) for creating isomorphic web apps using the latest versions of React, React Router and Webpack.

It's a work in progress and meant for personal use.

__Currently Using:__

React 0.14.0
React Router 1.0.0-rc3
Webpack 1.12.2

## Setup

Pretty standard stuff. Simply clone the repo, then do the usual:

    npm install

To kick it off, do

    npm start


## To-Dos

* Add LESS handling to webpack
* Add testing framework
* Add ESLint 
* Extend/optimize Webpack config for chunking
* Optional ES6 version, maybe
* Docs
